        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bayerautomation/" target="_blank">Andreas Bayer</a> — a systems architect, tech leader, and hands-on engineer with a proven track record of scaling platforms at IPO-stage startups and driving engineering teams through high-stakes acquisitions.</p>
            
            <p>From lean startups to Fortune 500 giants, I solve tough technical challenges. Whether modernizing legacy systems or building new LLM-driven platforms, I bring a simple approach: <strong>get in, figure it out, get it done</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve rebuilt critical infrastructure, launched full-stack SaaS products solo, and led cross-functional teams in engineering, data, and AI. My clients don’t need hand-holding—they need results, and that’s exactly what I deliver.</p>
            
            <p>Here’s what sets me apart. I don’t just talk architecture—I build it. I don’t prototype—I ship. With a blend of deep technical expertise and a get-it-done mentality, I tackle everything from autonomous agents to scaling cloud systems and rewriting broken platforms in weeks, not quarters.</p>
            
            <p>As a co-founder and entrepreneur, I’ve been involved in IPOs and acquisitions, giving me a unique perspective on scaling from startup to public company. My experience extends beyond tech to strategic, operational, and financial success.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, I was Co-Founder & CTO at Beam Solutions, which was acquired by Jumio. I’ve also held senior engineering leadership positions at Xoom, where I was instrumental in its IPO and acquisition by PayPal, and was an early employee at MuleSoft, which went public before being acquired by Salesforce for $6.5B. Additionally, I spent over a decade teaching computer science at UCSC Extension, sharing my passion for tech and mentoring the next generation of engineers.</p>
